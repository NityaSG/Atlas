36622792,1.0,"Self-perceived statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are prevalent, but only a minority is drug-dependent. Diagnostic biomarkers are not yet identified. The local statin exposure in skeletal muscle tissue may correlate to the adverse effects. We aimed to determine whether atorvastatin metabolites in blood reflect the corresponding metabolite levels in skeletal muscle, and whether genetic variants of statin transporters modulate this relationship. We also addressed atorvastatin metabolites as potential objective biomarkers of SAMS. Muscle symptoms were examined in patients with coronary disease and self-perceived SAMS during 7 weeks of double-blinded treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day and placebo in randomized order. A subset of 12 patients individually identified with more muscle symptoms on atorvastatin than placebo (confirmed SAMS) and 15 patients with no difference in muscle symptom intensity (non-SAMS) attended the present follow-up study. All received 7 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day followed by 8 weeks without statins. Biopsies from the quadriceps muscle and blood plasma were collected after each treatment period. Strong correlations (rho > 0.7) between muscle and blood plasma concentrations were found for most atorvastatin metabolites. The impact of the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (rs4149056) gene variant on atorvastatin's systemic pharmacokinetics was translated into muscle tissue. The SLCO2B1 c.395G>A (rs12422149) variant did not modulate the accumulation of atorvastatin metabolites in muscle tissue. Atorvastatin pharmacokinetics in patients with confirmed SAMS were not different from patients with non-SAMS. In conclusion, atorvastatin metabolite levels in skeletal muscle and plasma are strongly correlated, implying that plasma measurements are suitable proxies of atorvastatin exposure in muscle tissue. The relationship between atorvastatin metabolites in plasma and SAMS deserves further investigation."

36346115,1.0,"Low-dose aspirin has been hypothesized to prevent cancer risk by inhibiting platelet aggregation. However, the anti-cancer effect of low-dose aspirin has recently been questioned and its effect on breast cancer development remains unclear. The impact of other antiplatelet drugs on breast cancer risk has rarely been evaluated. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the associations between breast cancer risk and antiplatelet drug use in a nationwide nested case-control study. From the Danish healthcare registries, we identified as cases all women with invasive breast cancer diagnosis between 2001 and 2018 (n = 68 852). The date of diagnosis corresponded to the index date. We matched cases to 10 population controls on age and calendar time, using risk set sampling. Controls were assigned the same index date as their matched case. We used the prescription registry to identify exposure to low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole. We defined ever use of antiplatelet drugs as at least two prescriptions filled up to 1 year before the index date. We applied conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs, overall, by breast cancer subtype and by cumulative dose. Twelve percent of women had ever been exposed to low-dose aspirin, 2% to clopidogrel and 2% to dipyridamole. In multivariable models, breast cancer risk was not associated with ever use of low-dose aspirin (OR = 1.00 [0.97-1.03]), clopidogrel (OR = 0.93 [0.87-1.00]), and dipyridamole (OR = 1.02 [0.94-1.10]), compared with never use, and there was no evidence of a dose-response relation. However, we found an inverse association between dipyridamole use and breast cancer risk among women aged <55 years old, with suggestion of a dose-response relationship (OR per 1000 Defined Daily Doses = 0.72 [0.54-0.95]). Associations did not differ by breast cancer histological type, estrogen receptor status or clinical stage at diagnosis. Overall, the findings from this study do not support the use of antiplatelet drugs for breast cancer prevention."
37006988,1.0,"Devices such as stents and flow diverters require the use of safe and fast antiplatelet therapy. We aimed to compare the responses to clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor by assessing the Platelet Function Analysis (PFA-100)-Innovance test results of patients undergoing endovascular stenting to determine their resistance rates. Sixty-one women and 55 men, aged 18-87 years, were included in this study. Patients were divided into three groups: clopidogrel treatment, prasugrel treatment, and ticagrelor treatment. The systemic diseases of the patients, especially hypertension and diabetes, were recorded. The test results were evaluated according to the results for the collagen/epinephrine (COL-EPI), collagen/adenosine (COL-ADP), and P2Y results. The PFA-100-Innovance results for COL-EPI and P2Y were significantly higher for patients treated with prasugrel and ticagrelor compared with patients treated with clopidogrel (COL-EPI, <i>p</i> = 0.001; P2Y, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Clopidogrel resistance was identified in 31 patients (26.7%), and prasugrel resistance was identified in 4 patients (3.4%). Ticagrelor resistance was not detected. Therefore, 30.1% of patients were classified as drug-resistant. Perioperative bleeding was not detected in any patient. Hypertension was the most common disease recorded for patients being treated for cerebral aneurysm, and diabetes was the most common disease recorded for patients who underwent peripheral artery stenting (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Potent antiplatelet agents, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, have a low rate of resistance but are associated with an increased bleeding risk. Thus, the choice of a suitable drug during the treatment window remains a critical factor when determining treatment strategies."

37023313,1.0,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most important cause of chronic renal and end-stage kidney disease in China. Hypertension (HTN) is highly prevalent in individuals with diabetic nephropathy. Arterial HTN affects two-thirds of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In these patients, HTN increased the potential of both micro- and macrovascular complications, and the co-occurrence of 2 such principal causes results in a 4-fold increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) when contrasted with normotensive controls without diabetes. Therefore, the results of valsartan and amlodipine tablets combined with alpha-lipoic acid on total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) need to be investigated. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of valsartan (VA) and amlodipine tablets combined with alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA) on T-AOC, IL-6 and β2-MG levels in patients with DN. We performed statistical analysis including the chi-square test, independent t-test, paired t-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Our findings indicate that VA, amlodipine and α-LA has a significant effect in patients with DN."

37002612,1.0,"In this observational case-control study, 107 cutaneous adverse reaction (CAR) cases (CAR+) manifesting up to 12 weeks after the start of treatment with antiseizure medication (ASM) were identified. Control groups consisted of 98 epilepsy patients without a history of CAR (CAR-) and 3965 healthy individuals in the Brazilian National Registry of Bone Marrow Donors. All participants were HLA typed by high-resolution Next Generation Sequencing for HLA-A, B, C, DQB1 and DRB1; HLA-DPA1, DPB1, DQA1, DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5 were also sequenced in samples from CAR+ and CAR- individuals. The relationship between the carrier frequency of each allele, CAR type and ASM for all participants was investigated. The ASMs most frequently associated with CAR were carbamazepine (48% of CAR+ subjects), lamotrigine (23%), phenytoin (18%), phenobarbital (13%) and oxcarbazepine (5%). The main alleles associated with a risk of CAR were HLA-A*02:05 (OR = 6.28; p = 0.019, carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine); HLA-DPA1*02:02 (OR = 4.16, p = 0.003, carbamazepine); HLA-B*53:01 (OR = 47.9, p = 0.014, oxcarbazepine), HLA-DPA1*03:01/DPB1*105:01 (OR = 25.7, p = 0.005, phenobarbital); HLA-C*02:10 (OR = 25.7, p = 0.005, phenobarbital) and HLA-DRB1*04:02 (OR = 17.22, p = 0.007, phenytoin). HLA-A*03:01 increased the risk for phenytoin-induced maculopapular exanthema 4.71-fold (p = 0.009), and HLA-B*35:02 was associated with a 25.6-fold increase in the risk of carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (p = 0.005). None of the 4170 subjects carried the HLA-B*15:02 allele, and HLA-A*31:01 was not associated with CAR. Hence, HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 were not associated with CAR in this population. Although other HLA class I and II alleles tested were associated with a risk of CAR, none of these associations were strong enough to warrant HLA testing before prescribing ASM."

37043676,1.0,"Drug-drug interaction potentials of ensitrelvir, a novel oral inhibitor of 3C-like protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, for drug transporters were evaluated by in vitro and clinical studies. The target drug transporters assessed were P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 and 2K. In vitro study revealed that ensitrelvir is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and inhibits P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OAT3. Based on these results, a clinical drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of ensitrelvir on the pharmacokinetics of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 substrates was conducted with a cocktail approach using digoxin (P-gp substrate), rosuvastatin (BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 substrate), and metformin (OCT1 substrate). The cocktail was administered first, and after the washout period, the cocktail was coadministered with 500 mg of ensitrelvir. No treatment-emergent adverse events were observed. Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that the ratios (90% confidence intervals) of ""cocktail with ensitrelvir"" to ""cocktail without ensitrelvir"" for maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve were, respectively, 2.17 (1.72-2.73) and 1.31 (1.13-1.52) for digoxin, 1.97 (1.73-2.25) and 1.65 (1.47-1.84) for rosuvastatin, and 1.03 (0.91-1.16) and 1.02 (0.94-1.11) for metformin. The results indicate that the exposure levels of digoxin and rosuvastatin increased when coadministered with ensitrelvir, but those of metformin were not changed. In conclusion, ensitrelvir has an impact on the exposure levels of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 substrates."

37042284,1.0,"Background Clopidogrel monotherapy was more effective in reducing the risk of adverse clinical events than aspirin monotherapy in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES), according to the HOST-EXAM (Harmonizing Optimal Strategy for Treatment of Coronary Artery Stenosis-Extended Antiplatelet Monotherapy) trial. However, it remains unknown whether these effects differ based on sex. Methods and Results This was a prespecified secondary analysis of HOST-EXAM in South Korea. Patients who maintained dual antiplatelet therapy without adverse clinical events for 6 to 18 months after PCI with DES were included. The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) bleeding type ≥3 at 24 months after randomization. The bleeding end point was BARC types 2 to 5. The primary end point was comparable between the sexes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.62-1.02]; <i>P</i>=0.067), and the bleeding end point (adjusted HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.54-1.17]; <i>P</i>=0.240) was also similar. Compared with aspirin, clopidogrel was associated with lower risk of primary composite end point (adjusted HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.55-0.89]; <i>P</i>=0.004) and bleeding end point (adjusted HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.44-0.96]; <i>P</i>=0.031) in men but not in women. Conclusions The primary composite end point and bleeding events were comparable between the sexes during chronic maintenance antiplatelet monotherapy after PCI with DES. Clopidogrel monotherapy, compared with aspirin, significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite end point and bleeding events in men. However, the beneficial effect of clopidogrel on the primary end point and bleeding events was mitigated in women. Registration Information clinicaltrials.gov. Identifier: NCT02044250."

37076409,1.0,"Mycobacterium abscessus is a nontuberculous mycobacterium that is often multi-drug resistant, difficult to eradicate and associated with a rapid decline in lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF). Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) is a combination CFTR modulator that improves lung function and decreases exacerbations, but limited data exists about its impact on respiratory infections. A 23-year-old male with CF (F508del, unknown) was diagnosed with Mycobacterium abscessus subspecies abscessus infection. He completed 12-weeks of intensive therapy, followed by oral continuation therapy. Antimicrobials were later discontinued for optic neuritis secondary to linezolid. He remained off antimicrobials with persistently positive sputum cultures. He then initiated ETI, and bronchoscopy eight months later suggested eradication of M. abscessus. By modulating CFTR protein function, ETI may improve innate airway defence mechanisms, facilitating the clearance of infections such as M. abscessus. This case highlights the potential positive implications of ETI on the challenging treatment of M. abscessus infections in CF."
37070438,1.0,"Linezolid is increasingly utilized to treat gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics like vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as drug-resistant tuberculosis.

Consequently, in a 12-month pragmatic, randomized clinical trial, we aimed to investigate differences in antidepressive effectiveness among amisulpride, aripiprazole, and olanzapine as a secondary outcome, measured by change in the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia sum score in patients within the schizophrenia spectrum."
37093495,1.0,"Management of diverticular abscess (DA) is still controversial. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in abscesses ≤ 4 cm, while percutaneous drainage/surgery in abscesses > 4 cm. The study aims to assess the role of antibiotics and surgical treatments in patients affected by DA. We retrospectively analyzed 100 consecutive patients with DA between 2013 and 2020, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. They were divided into two groups depending on abscess size ≤ or > 4 cm (group 1 and group 2, respectively). All patients were initially treated with intravenous antibiotics. Surgery was considered in patients with generalized peritonitis at admission or after the failure of antibiotic therapy. The primary endpoint was to compare recurrence rates for antibiotics and surgery. The secondary endpoint was to assess the failure rate of each antibiotic regimen resulting in surgery. In group 1, 31 (72.1%) patients were conservatively treated and 12 (27.9%) underwent surgery. In group 2, percentages were respectively 50.9% (29 patients) and 49.1% (28 patients). We observed 4 recurrences in group 1 and 6 in group 2. Recurrence required surgery in 3 patients/group. We administered amoxicillin-clavulanic acid to 74 patients, piperacillin-tazobactam to 14 patients and ciprofloxacin + metronidazole to 12 patients. All patients referred to surgery had been previously treated with amoxicillin-Powered by Editorial Manager<sup>®</sup> and ProduXion Manager<sup>®</sup> from Aries Systems Corporation clavulanic acid. No percutaneous drainage was performed in a hundred consecutive patients. Surgical treatment was associated with a lower risk of recurrence in patients with abscess > 4 cm, compared to antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was associated with a higher therapeutic failure rate than piperacillin-tazobactam/ciprofloxacin + metronidazole."
37095689,1.0,"We compared the efficacy and safety of third-standard-dose triple and third-standard-dose dual antihypertensive combination therapies in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. This was a phase II multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 245 participants were randomized to the third-dose triple combination (ALC group; amlodipine 1.67 mg + losartan potassium 16.67 mg + chlorthalidone 4.17 mg) or third-dose dual combination (AL group; amlodipine 1.67 mg + losartan potassium 16.67 mg, LC group; losartan potassium 16.67 mg + chlorthalidone 4.17 mg, AC group; amlodipine 1.67 mg + chlorthalidone 4.17 mg) therapy groups and followed up for 8 weeks. The mean systolic blood pressure (BP) reduction was -18.3 ± 13.2, -13.0 ± 13.3, -16.3 ± 12.4, and -13.8 ± 13.2 mmHg in the ALC, AL, LC, and AC groups, respectively. The ALC group showed significant systolic BP reduction compared to the AL and AC groups at weeks 4 (P = .010 and P = .018, respectively) and 8 (P = .017 and P = .036, respectively). At week 4, the proportion of systolic BP responders was significantly higher in the ALC group (42.6%) than in the AL (22.0%), LC (23.3%), and AC (27.1%) groups (P = .013, P = .021, and P = .045, respectively). At week 8, the proportion of systolic and diastolic BP responders was significantly higher in the ALC group (59.7%) than in the AL (39.3%) and AC (42.4%) groups (P = .022 and P = .049, respectively) at week 8. Third-standard-dose triple antihypertensive combination therapy demonstrated early effective BP control compared to third-standard-dose dual combination therapies, without increasing adverse drug reactions in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension."
37115412,1.0,"The eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) decreased gradually. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy and safety of a 14-day combination of vonoprazan and amoxicillin as the first-line eradication therapy for H. pylori infection and compared them with those of the bismuth quadruple therapy. A prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed, involving patients with H. pylori infection in 6 institutions who did not receive any treatment yet. They were randomly assigned into the VA-dual group (vonoprazan 20 mg b.i.d + amoxicillin 750 mg q.i.d) or EACP-quadruple group (esomeprazole 20 mg + amoxicillin 1000 mg + clarithromycin 500 mg + colloidal bismuth subcitrate 220 mg b.i.d) for 14 days in a ratio of 1:1. At least 28 days later, the eradication rate was detected by the <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath test (UBT). A total of 562 patients from February 2022 to September 2022 were enrolled and 316 were random. In the ITT analysis, the eradication rates of H. pylori in the VA-dual group and EACP-quadruple group were 89.9% and 81.0%, respectively, p = 0.037. In the PP analysis were 97.9% and 90.8%, p = 0.009. The different eradication rate was 8.9% (95% CI 1.2-16.5%) and 7.2% (95% CI 1.8-12.4%) in ITT and PP analyses, both lower limit of the 95%CI was still higher than the prespecified margin. In addition, the incidence of adverse events in the VA-dual group was significantly lower than that in the EACP-quadruple group (19.0% vs. 43.0%, P < 0.001). The efficacy and safety of a 14-day combination therapy of vonoprazan and amoxicillin in eradicating H. pylori are superior to bismuth quadruple therapy, and this combination significantly reduces the use of antibiotics."

Autopsy findings (cyanosis and polyvisceral congestion) and blood tramadol (TR) concentration of 6240 μg/L were consistent with an acute TR intoxication. In this poisoning situation, owing to the mother's statements (TR addiction leading to daily TR-orange juice mixture preparation accidentally used for the baby bottle preparation by the mother's partner), and the question of possible previous TR administrations to the infant, hair and/or nails (infant, mother, partner, 6-year-old sister) analysis was performed. Hair (2-cm-long hair segments from proximal [S1] to distal [S3]) and nails concentrations (pg/mg; nd: not detected) were as follows: Infant (hair: TR 1420 [S1], 1622 [S2], 2736 [S3]; O-DMT 16-38; N-DMT 34-100 [TR in significant quantities in the hair decontamination bath]-toenails: TR 584; O-DMT 8; N-DMT 15), mother (hair: TR 2340 [S1], 2150 [S2], 2500 [S3]; O-DMT 704-1170; N-DMT 827-1360), mother's partner (fingernails: TR 72; O-DMT nd; N-DMT nd) and sister (hair: TR 261 [S1], 524 [S2]; O-DMT 15 [S1], 16 [S2]; N-DMT 20 [S1], 38 [S2]). Metabolite ratio (infant and sister hair) was comparable to those observed in hair of pharmaceutical industry employees manufacturing tramadol. TR in washing baths, low observed nail concentrations (infant and partner) confirm (i) TR-related mother's addiction and (ii) external contamination issues (TR in sweat of the child at the time of death and in living environment) to explain the infant's keratinized samples results.

37039890,1.0,"Although several studies provided evidence on the epidemiology of drug-induced Parkinsonism (DIP) and its causative drugs, it is still limited in pediatrics. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk of DIP in pediatrics. We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-Pediatric Patients Sample in Korea between 2010 and 2017 to estimate the annual prevalence of DIP and causative drug use using a cross-sectional design. The risk of DIP associated with causative drugs was evaluated using a case-crossover design. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a conditional logistic regression. A total of 2925 pediatric patients had diagnosed with DIP from 2010 to 2017. Most patients were aged between 12 and19 years old, and 99.8% had any diagnosis of mental health disorder (MHD). During the study period, the prevalence of DIP increased by 10.0-fold from 2010 to 2017. All causative drugs showed a corresponding increase in their use, with atypical antipsychotics being the most prominent (increase ratio, 2.07). For both in the prevalence of DIP and atypical antipsychotic use, the increment was much bigger in patients with non-psychotic MHD than that in patients with psychotic MHD. In the case-crossover study, antipsychotics showed the largest aOR with DIP. Risperidone among antipsychotics showed the highest risk for DIP (aOR = 7.09, 95% CI = 3.83-13.09), followed by aripiprazole (aOR = 5.03, 95% CI = 2.88-8.80). This study suggests that the increase in DIP prevalence in pediatric patients might be because of the increased use of atypical antipsychotics."
36936699,1.0,"In the medical community, antibiotics are revered as a miracle because they stop diseases brought on by pathogenic bacteria. Antibiotics have become the cornerstone of contemporary medical advancements ever since penicillin was discovered. Antibiotic resistance developed among germs quickly, placing a strain in the medical field. Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), Since 1961, has emerged as the major general antimicrobial resistant bacteria (AMR) worldwide. MRSA can easily transmit across the hospital system and has mostly gained resistance to medications called beta-lactamases. This enzyme destroys the cell wall of beta-lactam antibiotics resulting in resistance against that respective antibiotic. Daptomycin, linezolid and vancomycin were previously used to treat MRSA infections. However, due to mutations and Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Open reading frames (ORFs) and SCCmec machinery of respective antibody, MRSA developed resistance against those antibiotics. The MRSA strains (USA300, CC398, CC130 etc.), when their pan-genomes were analyzed were found the genes involved in invoking resistance against the antibiotics as well as the epidemiology of that respective strain. PENC (penicillin plus potassium clavulanate) is the new antibiotic showing potential in treatment of MRSA though it is itself resistant against penicillin alone. In this review, our main focus is on mechanism of development of AMR in MRSA, how different ORFs are involved in evoking resistance in MRSA and what is the core-genome of different antimicrobial resistant MRSA."
35707933,1.0,"<b>Objective:</b> Statin-associated autoimmune myopathy (SAAM) is a rare adverse event characterized by progressive muscle symptoms despite discontinuation, requiring immunosuppressive therapy for remission. The objective of this review was to characterize SAAM, for timely detection, while examining the literature for effective treatment considerations. <b>Methods:</b> PubMed search was conducted from 2010 to 2020 was for relevant case series and studies of at least 8 patients displaying muscle discomfort or weakness, anti-HMGCR antibodies, exposure to statins, and biopsies consistent with SAAM. <b>Results:</b> Three case series and 3 case cohort studies identified 199 patients with SAAM. Exhibiting a mean age of 63.74 years, patients were more likely Caucasian (81%) and female (1.2X), and required a mean duration of 4.75 years before symptomatic. The presentation involved proximal muscle weakness (94%), myalgias (37%) and dysphagia (23%), accompanied by a mean creatinine kinase of 6383 IU/L. Most patients (57%) required 2 or more immunosuppressive (IMS) agents to achieve 62% remission. After 2 years of treatment, 15% of patients without remission reported symptomatic improvement, while another 12% were refractory to treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> Delayed onset of SAAM greater than 4 years from statin initiation may create a low index of suspicion. However, progression of symptoms beyond 2 months from statin discontinuation and positive anti-HMGCR antibodies requires immunosuppressive agents. Data and expert opinion support use of at least two IMS medications upon diagnosis for a minimum of 2 years. Therapy success depends on timely recognition and initiation of IMS combinations to achieve earlier remission and symptomatic improvement."

36999361,0.0,"Orally administered drugs undergo four stages of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in the body. However, before being absorbed into the body, orally administered drugs contact with gut microbiota, which catalyze their metabolic reactions such as reduction, hydroxylation (including deconjugation), dehydrogenation, acetylation, etc. Although these metabolic reactions typically inactivate drugs (ranitidine, digoxin, and amlodipine), some activate them (sulfasalazine). The composition and quantity of gut microbiota are variable across individuals and fluctuated by gut microbiota modulators such as diets, drugs (antibiotics), probiotics, prebiotics, pathogen infections, and stressors. Gut microbiota-involved metabolisms of drugs in the gastrointestinal tract are dependent on the composition and quantity of gut microbiota. Therefore, the bioavailability of orally administered drugs is significantly affected by gut microbiota modulators. This review describes gut microbiota modulator-drug interactions."

The local clinical microbiology laboratory discontinued routine susceptibilities on enterococcal urine isolates, and reports that 'APs are predictably reliable for uncomplicated enterococcal UTI'. The objective of this study was to compare outcomes of APs with non-APs (NAPs) for enterococcal lower UTIs. This was an institutional-review-board-approved, retrospective cohort of adults hospitalized with symptomatic enterococcal lower UTIs from 2013 to 2021. The primary endpoint was composite clinical success at 14 days, defined as resolution of symptoms without new symptoms and no repeat culture growth of the index organism. A non-inferiority analysis was utilized with a 15% margin, and logistic regression evaluated characteristics associated with 14-day failure. In total, 178 subjects were included: 89 AP patients and 89 NAP patients. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were identified in 73 (82%) AP patients and 76 (85%) NAP patients (P=0.54); in total, 34 (38.2%) AP patients and 66 (74.2%) NAP patients had confirmed Enterococcus faecium (P<0.001). Amoxicillin (n=36, 40.5%) and ampicillin (n=36, 40.5%) were the most commonly used APs, and linezolid (n=41, 46%) and fosfomycin (n=30, 34%) were the most commonly used NAPs. Fourteen-day clinical success rates for APs and NAPs were 83.1% and 82.0%, respectively [1.1% difference, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) -0.117 to 0.139]. Among the E. faecium subgroup, 14-day clinical success was observed in 27/34 (79.4%) AP patients and 53/66 (80.3%) NAP patients (P=0.916). On logistic regression, APs were not associated with 14-day clinical failure (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.38-1.86). APs were non-inferior to NAPs for treating enterococcal lower UTIs, and may be considered irrespective of susceptibility results."
37001384,0.0,"Plastic surgery frequently employs random skin flaps. However, its clinical applicability is constrained by flap necrosis brought on by ischemia-reperfusion damage. Flap survival is aided by rosuvastatin, a naturally occurring flavonoid primarily obtained from plants. In this research, we looked into the processes mediating the effects of rosuvastatin on flap survival. All experimental mice were randomly assigned to three groups: control, rosuvastatin, and 3-methyladenine (3MA) plus rosuvastatin. These groups were, respectively, treated with dimethyl sulfoxide solution, rosuvastatin, and rosuvastatin combined with 3MA. After that, the animals were euthanized so that histology and protein analyses could determine the extent of angiogenesis, pyroptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy. In addition to lessening tissue edema, rosuvastatin promoted the survival of the skin flap. Rosuvastatin also promoted angiogenesis, reduced oxidative stress, induced autophagy, and reduced pyroptosis. According to the study's findings, rosuvastatin increases angiogenesis, prevents pyroptosis, and reduces oxidative stress by inducing autophagy, which improves the survival rate of random skin flaps."

Nitro group reduction of the latter resulted in the corresponding 8-aminoquinolone-3-esters which upon hydrolysis formed the respective 8-amino-7-(aryl/hetaryl)-quinolone-3-carboxylic acids. The latter compounds were tested against selected Gram-negative bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, and <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i>) and Gram-positive bacteria (<i>Enterococcus feacalis</i>, <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>). The tested fluoroquinolones showed a significant antimicrobial activity against most of the tested bacterial strains. The antimicrobial activity of some of the tested compounds were comparable to or higher than a wide range of standard antibiotics including ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem.

36773381,0.0,"Electrospun fibers, often used as drug delivery systems, have two drawbacks - in the first stage of their action a sudden active substance burst release occurs and they have a relatively small capacity for a drug. In this work the fibers are modified by the addition of drug-loaded microspheres acting as micro-containers for the drug and increasing the total drug capacity of the system. Its release from such a structure is slowed down by placing the microspheres inside the fibers so they are covered with an outer layer of fiber-forming polymer. The work presents a new method (microsphere suspension electrospinning) of obtaining polyvinylpyrrolidone fibers cross-linked with UV light modified with polycaprolactone/polyethersulphone microspheres loaded with active substance - rhodamine 640 as a marker or ampicillin as a drug example. The influence of UV-cross-linking time and the microspheres addition on the degradation, mechanical strength and transport properties of fibrous mats was investigated. The mats were insoluble in water, in some cases mechanically stronger, their drug capacity was increased and the burst effect was eliminated. The antibacterial properties of ampicillin-loaded mats were confirmed. The product of proposed suspension electrospinning process has application potential as a drug delivery system."
36848786,0.0,"Herein, the toxicity of 4 MPs and additives released from MPs during UV-aging was quantitatively evaluated by the transcriptional effect level index (TELI) based on E. coli whole-cell microarray assay, and MPs-antibiotics complex pollutants. Results showed that MPs and these additives had high toxicity potential, the maximum TELI was 5.68/6.85 for polystyrene (PS)/bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). There were many similar toxic pathways between MPs and additives, indicating that part of the toxicity risk of MPs was caused by the release of additives. MPs were compounded with antibiotics, the toxicity value changed significantly. The TELI values of amoxicillin (AMX) + polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) + PVC were as high as 12.30 and 14.58 (P < 0.05). Three antibiotics all decreased the toxicity of PS and had little effect on polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). The combined toxicity mechanism of MPs and antibiotics was very complicated, and the results could be divided into four types: MPs (PVC/PE + CIP), antibiotics (PVC + TC, PS + AMX/ tetracycline (TC)/CIP, PE + TC), both (PP + AMX/TC/CIP), or brand-new mechanisms (PVC + AMX)."

36996249,0.0,"Low-cost, rapid, and accurate acquisition of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) is key to limiting the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Until now, conventional antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) methods are typically time-consuming, high-cost, and labor-intensive, making them difficult to accomplish this task. Herein, an electricity-free, portable, and robust handyfuge microfluidic chip was developed for on-site AST, termed handyfuge-AST. With simply handheld centrifugation, the bacterial-antibiotic mixtures with accurate antibiotic concentration gradients could be generated in less than 5 min. The accurate MIC values of single antibiotics (including ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol) or their combinations against <i>Escherichia coli</i> could be obtained within 5 h. To further meet the growing demands of point-of-care testing, we upgraded our handyfuge-AST with a pH-based colorimetric strategy, enabling naked eye recognition or intelligent recognition with a homemade mobile app. Through a comparative study of 60 clinical data (10 clinical samples corresponding to six commonly used antibiotics), the accurate MICs by handyfuge-AST with 100% categorical agreements were achieved compared to clinical standard methods (area under curves, AUCs = 1.00). The handyfuge-AST could be used as a low-cost, portable, and robust point-of-care device to rapidly obtain accurate MIC values, which significantly limit the progress of AMR."
36642266,0.0,"This study screened a Trichoderma strain (Trichoderma pubescens DAOM 166162) from activated sludge to solve the limitation of traditional biological processes in the treatment of amoxicillin (AMO) containing wastewater. The mechanism of the removal of AMO wastewater by T. pubescens DAOM 166162 (TPC) was studied. AMO resulted in a higher protein percentage in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by TPC, which facilitated the removal of AMO from the wastewater. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and excitation-emission matrix were used to characterize EPS produced by metabolizing different carbon sources. It was found that the hydroxyl group was the primary functional group in EPS. The life activity of TPC was the cause of the pH rise. The main pathway of degradation of AMO by TPC was the hydroxyl group uncoupling the lactam ring and the hydrolysis of AMO in an alkaline environment. The removal efficiency of AMO in wastewater by TPC was >98 % (24 h), of which the biodegradation efficiency was 70.01 ± 1.48 %, and the biosorption efficiency was 28.44 ± 2.97 %. In general, TPC is an effective strain for treating wastewater containing AMO. This research provides a new idea for AMO wastewater treatment."

We aimed to determine whether atorvastatin metabolites in blood reflect the corresponding metabolite levels in skeletal muscle, and whether genetic variants of statin transporters modulate this relationship. We also addressed atorvastatin metabolites as potential objective biomarkers of SAMS. Muscle symptoms were examined in patients with coronary disease and self-perceived SAMS during 7 weeks of double-blinded treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day and placebo in randomized order. A subset of 12 patients individually identified with more muscle symptoms on atorvastatin than placebo (confirmed SAMS) and 15 patients with no difference in muscle symptom intensity (non-SAMS) attended the present follow-up study. All received 7 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day followed by 8 weeks without statins. Biopsies from the quadriceps muscle and blood plasma were collected after each treatment period. Strong correlations (rho > 0.7) between muscle and blood plasma concentrations were found for most atorvastatin metabolites. The impact of the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (rs4149056) gene variant on atorvastatin's systemic pharmacokinetics was translated into muscle tissue. The SLCO2B1 c.395G>A (rs12422149) variant did not modulate the accumulation of atorvastatin metabolites in muscle tissue. Atorvastatin pharmacokinetics in patients with confirmed SAMS were not different from patients with non-SAMS. In conclusion, atorvastatin metabolite levels in skeletal muscle and plasma are strongly correlated, implying that plasma measurements are suitable proxies of atorvastatin exposure in muscle tissue. The relationship between atorvastatin metabolites in plasma and SAMS deserves further investigation."

Rats were divided into 5 groups: (1) control, (2) hypercholesterolaemia, (3) melatonin administrated concurrently with cholesterol diet, (4) melatonin administrated only last 2 weeks and fed with cholesterol diet, (5) atorvastatin administered only last 2 weeks fed with cholesterol diet. Although an increase was observed in the expressions of visfatin and STAT-3 and the serum ADMA levels, the vaspin and DDAH protein expressions were found to decrease with hypercholesterolemic diets. Melatonin was determined to restore all the parameters to the normal levels. In conclusion, melatonin may have protective and therapeutic effects on hypercholesterolaemia by regulating vaspin, STAT-3, DDAH, and ADMA signalling pathways and create similar effects with atorvastatin."

36809063,0.0,"In Chinese zoos, there are usually specially designed bird parks, similar to petting zoos, that allow children and adults to interact with diverse birds. However, such behaviors present a risk for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens. Recently, we isolated eight strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and identified two <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M</sub>-positive strains from 110 birds, including parrots, peacocks, and ostriches, using anal or nasal swabs in a bird park of a zoo in China. There, K. pneumoniae LYS105A was obtained from a diseased peacock with chronic respiratory diseases by a nasal swab, which harbored the <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-3</sub> gene and exhibited resistance to amoxicillin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, tigecycline, florfenicol, and enrofloxacin. According to an analysis by whole-genome sequencing, K. pneumoniae LYS105A belongs to serotype ST859 (sequence type 859)-K19 (capsular serotype 19) and contains two plasmids, of which pLYS105A-2 can be transferred by electrotransformation and harbors numerous resistance genes such as <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-3</sub>, <i>aac(6')-Ib-cr5</i>, and <i>qnrB91</i>. The above-mentioned genes are located in a novel mobile composite transposon, Tn<i>7131</i>, which makes horizontal transfer more flexible. Although no known genes were identified in the chromosome, a significant increase in SoxS upregulated the expression levels of <i>phoPQ</i>, <i>acrEF</i>-<i>tolC</i>, and <i>oqxAB</i>, which contributed to strain LYS105A acquiring resistance to tigecycline (MIC = 4 mg/L) and intermediate resistance to colistin (MIC = 2 mg/L). Altogether, our findings show that bird parks in zoos may act as important vehicles for the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria from birds to humans and vice versa. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A multidrug-resistant ST859-K19 K. pneumoniae strain, LYS105A, was obtained from a diseased peacock in a Chinese zoo. In addition, multiple resistance genes such as <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-3</sub>, <i>aac(6')-Ib-cr5</i>, and <i>qnrB91</i> were located in a novel composite transposon, Tn<i>7131</i>, of a mobile plasmid, implying that most of the resistance genes in strain LYS105A can be moved easily via horizontal gene transfer. Meanwhile, an increase in SoxS can further positively regulate the expression of <i>phoPQ</i>, <i>acrEF</i>-<i>tolC</i>, and <i>oqxAB</i>, which is the key factor for strain LYS105A to develop resistance to tigecycline and colistin. Taken together, these findings enrich our understanding of the horizontal cross-species spread of drug resistance genes, which will help us curb the development of bacterial resistance."
36732297,0.0,"Understanding evolution of antibiotic resistance is vital for containing its global spread. Yet our ability to in situ track highly heterogeneous and dynamic evolution is very limited. Here, we present a new single-cell approach integrating D<sub>2</sub> O-labeled Raman spectroscopy, advanced multivariate analysis, and genotypic profiling to in situ track physiological evolution trajectory toward resistance. Physiological diversification of individual cells from isogenic population with cyclic ampicillin treatment is captured. Advanced multivariate analysis of spectral changes classifies all individual cells into four subsets of sensitive, intrinsic tolerant, evolved tolerant and resistant. Remarkably, their dynamic shifts with evolution are depicted and spectral markers of each state are identified. Genotypic analysis validates the phenotypic shift and provides insights into the underlying genetic basis. The new platform advances rapid phenotyping resistance evolution and guides evolution control."

36720341,0.0,"Reducing the toxicity caused by antibiotics on bacterial communities in the soil is one of the great challenges of this century. For this, the effectiveness of amending the soil with different bioadsorbents such as crushed mussel shell (CMS), pine bark (PB) and biomass ash (BA), as well as combinations of them (CMS + PB and PB + BA) was studied at different doses (0 g kg<sup>-1</sup> to 48 g kg<sup>-1</sup>). Soil samples were spiked, separately, with increasing doses (0-2000 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) of cefuroxime (CMX), amoxicillin (AMX), clarithromycin (CLA), azithromycin (AZI), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and trimethoprim (TMP). Their toxicity on bacterial growth was estimated using the tritium-labeled leucine (<sup>3</sup>H) incorporation method. Toxicity was observed to behave differently depending on the antibiotic family and bioadsorbent, although in different magnitude and at different doses. The toxicity of β-lactams (AMX and CXM) was reduced by up to 54% when the highest doses of bio-adsorbents were added due to the increase in pH (CMS and BA) and carbon (PB) contribution. Macrolides (CLA and AZI) showed slight toxicity in un-amended soil samples, which increased by up to 65% with the addition of the bio-adsorbents. The toxicity of CIP (a fluoroquinolone) increased with the dose of the bio-adsorbents, reaching up to 20% compared with the control. Finally, the toxicity of TMP (a diaminopyrimidine) slightly increased with the dose of bio-adsorbents. The by-products that increase soil pH are those that showed the highest increases of CLA, AZI, CIP and TMP toxicities. These results could help to prevent/reduce environmental pollution caused by different kinds of antibiotics, selecting the most appropriated bio-adsorbents and doses."

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether pre-existing, outpatient medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reduce the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients from across the United States infected with COVID-19 in the year 2020. The main outcome was adjusted odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 amongst those positive for the infection. Outcomes were adjusted for known risk factors for severe disease. 3,974,272 patients aged 18 or older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in 2020 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Mean age was 50.7 (SD 18). Of this group, 290,348 patients (7.3%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19, similar to the CDC's reported estimate (7.5%).

36462825,0.0,"This study analyzed the effect of high-pressure processing on the changes in resistance phenotype and expression of antibiotic resistance genes among strains from commercial starter cultures. After exposure to high pressure the expression of genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides (aac(6')Ie-aph(2″)Ia and aph(3')-IIIa) decreased and the expression of genes encoding resistance to tetracyclines (tetM and tetW), ampicillin (blaZ) and chloramphenicol (cat) increased. Expression changes differed depending on the pressure variant chosen. The results obtained in the gene expression analysis correlated with the results of the phenotype patterns. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies focused on changes in antibiotic resistance associated with a stress response among strains from commercial starter cultures. The results suggest that the food preservation techniques might affect the phenotype of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms that ultimately survive the process. This points to the need to verify strains used in the food industry for their antibiotic resistance as well as preservation parameters to prevent the further increase in antibiotic resistance in food borne strains."
36503799,0.0,"The activated sludge process is characterized by high microbial density and diversity, both of which facilitate antibiotic resistance gene transfer. Many studies have suggested that antibiotic and non-antibiotic drugs at sub-inhibitory concentrations are major inducers of conjugative gene transfer. The self-transmissible plasmid pND6-2 is one of the endogenous plasmids harbored in Pseudomonas putida ND6, which can trigger the transfer of another co-occurring naphthalene-degrading plasmid pND6-1. Therefore, to illustrate the potential influence of stimulants on conjugative transfer of pND6-2, we evaluated the effects of four antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline) and naphthalene, on the conjugal transfer efficiency of pND6-2 by filter-mating experiment. Our findings demonstrated that all stimulants within an optimal dose promoted conjugative transfer of pND6-2 from Pseudomonas putida GKND6 to P. putida KT2440, with tetracycline being the most effective (100 µg/L and 10 µg/L), as it enhanced pND6-2-mediated intra-genera transfer by approximately one hundred-fold. Subsequently, seven AS reactors were constructed with the addition of donors and different stimulants to further elucidate the conjugative behavior of pND6-2 in natural environment. The stimulants positively affected the conjugal process of pND6-2, while donors reshaped the host abundance in the sludge. This was likely because stimulant addition enhanced the expression levels of conjugation transfer-related genes. Furthermore, Blastocatella and Chitinimonas were identified as the potential receptors of plasmid pND6-2, which was not affected by donor types. These findings demonstrate the positive role of sub-inhibitory stimulant treatment on pND6-2 conjugal transfer and the function of donors in re-shaping the host spectrum of pND6-2."
36779664,0.0,"We examined the impact of statins on protein kinase D (PKD) activation by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists. Treatment of intestinal IEC-18 cells with cerivastatin inhibited PKD autophosphorylation at Ser<sup>916</sup> induced by angiotensin II (ANG II) or vasopressin in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal inhibition at 0.2 µM. Cerivastatin treatment inhibited PKD activation stimulated by these agonists for different times (5-60 min) and blunted HDAC5 phosphorylation, a substrate of PKD. Other lipophilic statins, including simvastatin, atorvastatin, and fluvastatin also prevented PKD activation in a dose-dependent manner. Using IEC-18 cell lines expressing PKD1 tagged with EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein), cerivastatin or simvastatin blocked GPCR-mediated PKD1-EGFP translocation to the plasma membrane and its subsequent nuclear accumulation. Similar results were obtained in IEC-18 cells expressing PKD3-EGFP. Mechanistically, statins inhibited agonist-dependent PKD activation rather than acting directly on PKD catalytic activity since exposure to cerivastatin or simvastatin did not impair PKD autophosphorylation or PKD1-EGFP membrane translocation in response to phorbol dibutyrate, which bypasses GPCRs and directly stimulates PKC and PKD. Furthermore, cerivastatin did not inhibit recombinant PKD activity determined via an in vitro kinase assay. Using enteroids generated from intestinal crypt-derived epithelial cells from PKD1 transgenic mice as a model of intestinal regeneration, we show that statins oppose PKD1-mediated increase in enteroid area, complexity (number of crypt-like buds), and DNA synthesis. Our results revealed a previously unappreciated inhibitory effect of statins on receptor-mediated PKD activation and in opposing the growth-promoting effects of PKD1 on intestinal epithelial cells."

36967488,0.0,"The objective of the current study was to identify potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with the drug candidate fb-PMT, a novel anticancer thyrointegrin αvß3 antagonist. This was accomplished by using several in vitro assays to study interactions of fb-PMT with both cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and drug transporters, two common mechanisms leading to adverse drug effects. In vitro experiments showed that fb-PMT exhibited weak reversible inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In addition, fb-PMT did not show time-dependent inhibition with any of the seven CYP isoforms tested, including 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4. Human liver microsomal incubations demonstrated that fb-PMT is stable. Potential transporter-mediated DDIs with fb-PMT were assessed with two ATP binding cassette (ABC) family transporters (P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein) using Caco2 cells and seven solute carrier family (SLC) transporters (organic cation transporter OCT2, organic anion transporters OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporter peptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and the multidrug and toxic extrusion proteins MATE1 and MATE2-K using transfected HEK293 cells). Fb-PMT was not a substrate for any of the nine transporters tested in this study, nor did it inhibit the activity of seven of the transporters tested. However, fb-PMT inhibited the uptake of rosuvastatin by both OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations greater than 3 and less than 10 μM. In summary, data suggest that the systemic administration of fb-PMT is unlikely to lead to DDIs through CYP enzymes or ABC and SLC transporters in humans."
36995080,0.0,"Statins are considered as the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, where pleiotropic effects are thought to contribute greatly in addition to the lipid-lowering effect. Bile acid metabolism has been gradually reported to be involved in the antihyperlipidemic and antiatherosclerotic effects of statins, but with inconsistent results and few studies carried out on animal models of atherosclerosis. The study aimed to examine the possible role of bile acid metabolism in the lipid-lowering and antiatherosclerotic effects of atorvastatin (ATO) in high-fat diet-fed ApoE -/- mice. The results showed that the levels of liver and faecal TC as well as ileal and faecal TBA were significantly increased in mice of the model group after 20 weeks of high-fat diet feeding compared with the control group, with significantly downregulated mRNA expression of liver LXR-α, CYP7A1, BSEP, and NTCP. ATO treatment further increased the levels of ileal and faecal TBA and faecal TC, but no obvious effect was observed on serum and liver TBA. In addition, ATO significantly reversed the mRNA levels of liver CYP7A1 and NTCP, and no obvious changes were observed in the expression of LXR-α and BSEP. Our study suggested that statins may enhance the synthesis of bile acids and facilitate the reabsorption of bile acids from the ileum via portal into the liver, possibly through the upregulation of the expression of CYP7A1 and NTCP. The results are helpful in enriching the theoretical basis for the clinical use of statins and have good translational value."
